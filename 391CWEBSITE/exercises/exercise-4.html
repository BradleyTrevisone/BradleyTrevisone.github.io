        <h1> Potential Images for Website</h1>
        <h2> Image 1: Boston</h2>
            <p>Boston is the city I've spent exploring in different phases of my life. I find the photo has an observational<br> prospective, inserting you into a distanced dormancy watching the lively city while still being apart of it.</p>

         <h2> Image 2: Storyboarding Teamwork</h2>
             <p>I enjoy the image for its premise of team work and sharing the idea of storyboarding, with both being a <br>compenent of all creative works. It captures an ideal workspace with calmness, enjoyment, and artistic <br>value with an industrial office.</p>

        <h2> Image 3: Computer in a Cafe</h2>
             <p>I wanted to include an example of being a writer and designer while leaving it up for interpretation what I <br> could poetionally be working on. I believe a cafe setting also inserts more involvement in a community <br> than an at home office while still sharing a sense of personalness through stock photos I would not be able <br> to achieve if I used somebody elses home.</p>

         <h2> Image 4: Resturant Kitchen</h2>
             <p>To add indaviduality, I wanted to include a passion of mine while still aligning myself with people in the photo. <br> I find that my character can be aligned with the expoditer and it also inserts myself into an luxurious enviroment yet <br> stressful, artistic, and team oriented. </p>
