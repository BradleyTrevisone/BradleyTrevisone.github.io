                    <p><strong>Removing</strong> and <strong>limiting</strong> stimulating inputs will lead you to a happier, calmer, and more appretiative life. <br>It begins with understanding dopamine as a motivational chemical: not a happiness chemical.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>An Easy Experiment</h2>
                    <p>Next time you find youself struggling to begin a task, start by putting any imediate destractions away. <br>This includes such as your phone, music, and even acsessive caffine bevrages. Reset your motivation <br>levels by taking a 5 minute break to sit in silence while either looking out of a window or even a wall<br> that is at least 15 away from you.<br> When you reengage in your work, watch as your body begins to engage deeper as your body attempts<br> to restore its dopamine levels with this new task.<br><br>Please note that while this is helpful for your productivity, it's applicable to your daily life aswell.</p>
             <h2>Benifits</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>It makes switching between tasks an easier transition</li>
                    <li>You will be more focused while working on your task</li>
                    <li>You may find yourself wanting to engage more within your enviroment,<br>such as creating conversations with people close with you or finding more time in your day to <br>work on projects.</li>
                    <li>Your body begins to value simplicities as its not overwhelmed by<br> massive dopamine spikes that comes from a continous search for entertainment</li>
                 </ol>
